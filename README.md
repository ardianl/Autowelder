# Autowelder
This program was developed to be used with FLIR BFS-U3-50S5C cameras.
The program initializes and connects to the camera to receive images, and uses OpenCV to process the images. PySimpleGUI is used to display and interact with the image processing settings. The program is used to locate the center of a weld and calculate the distance from the true position.
